### 2. Data Preparation and Transformation
- **Using Excel:**
  - Load the downloaded dataset(s) into Excel.
  - Clean the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and correcting data types.
  - Perform any necessary transformations, such as creating new calculated columns, aggregating data, and formatting dates.

- **Using Power BI:**
  - Import the dataset(s) directly into Power BI.
  - Use the Power Query Editor to clean and transform the data:
    - Remove unnecessary columns and duplicates.
    - Handle missing values by filling in or removing them.
    - Convert data types to their appropriate formats.
    - Create new calculated columns and measures as needed.

### 3. Data Modeling
- Establish relationships between different tables if using multiple datasets.
- Create calculated columns and measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to enhance the dataset's analytical capabilities.

### 4. Visualization
- Design an interactive dashboard in Power BI by adding visualizations such as charts, graphs, maps, and tables.
- Use slicers and filters to enable dynamic data exploration.
- Arrange the visualizations in a logical and aesthetically pleasing layout.

### 5. Insights Generation
- Analyze the visualizations to extract meaningful insights.
- Summarize the key findings to provide a clear understanding of the data.


## Insights from Data
Based on the analysis of the hotel booking data, here are some key insights:

1. **Booking Trends:**
   - Identify peak booking periods and off-peak seasons.
   - Analyze the distribution of bookings across different days of the week and months of the year.

   - Identify the most and least effective channels in terms of volume and revenue.

4. **Cancellation Patterns:**
   - Examine the rate of booking cancellations and the reasons behind them.
   - Identify factors that contribute to higher cancellation rates.

5. **Revenue Analysis:**
   - Analyze the revenue generated from different customer segments and booking channels.
   - Identify trends in average daily rates (ADR) and revenue per available room (RevPAR).

6. **Customer Preferences:**
   - Identify common preferences among customers, such as preferred room types and special requests.
   - Assess the impact of customer preferences on booking decisions and revenue.

7. **Geographic Insights:**
